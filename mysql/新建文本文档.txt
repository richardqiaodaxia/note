A RANDOM PASSWORD HAS BEEN SET FOR THE MySQL root USER !
You will find that password in '/root/.mysql_secret'.

You must change that password on your first connect,
no other statement but 'SET PASSWORD' will be accepted.
See the manual for the semantics of the 'password expired' flag.

Also, the account for the anonymous user has been removed.

In addition, you can run:

  /usr/bin/mysql_secure_installation

which will also give you the option of removing the test database.
This is strongly recommended for production servers.

See the manual for more instructions.

WARNING: Found existing config file /usr/my.cnf on the system.
Because this file might be in use, it was not replaced,
but was used in bootstrap (unless you used --defaults-file)
and when you later start the server.
The new default config file was created as /usr/my-new.cnf,
please compare it with your file and take the changes you need.
